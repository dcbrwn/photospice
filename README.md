# Photospice

WebGL-based multi-pass photo-effect processor :P. No flash, plugins or even back-end needed. All magic happens inside of client's browser. This has some drawbacks though. Not all devices/browsers support WebGL. Also to smoothly handle a pipeline with a bunch of complex effects, users will need to have pretty good rig.

You can find current status and approximate roadmap [here](https://github.com/dcbrwn/photospice/projects/1).
