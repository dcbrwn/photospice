# Photospice [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/photospice/photospice.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/photospice/photospice)

For live demo click [here](https://photospice.github.io). Please keep in mind that the app is not optimized for mobile platforms yet.

WebGL-based multi-pass photo-effect processor :P. No flash, plugins or even back-end needed. All magic happens inside of client's browser. This has some drawbacks though. Not all devices/browsers support WebGL. Also to smoothly handle a pipeline with a bunch of complex effects, users will need to have pretty good rig.

You can find current status and approximate roadmap [here](https://github.com/dcbrwn/photospice/projects/1).
